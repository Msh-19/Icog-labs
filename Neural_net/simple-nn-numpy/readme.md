# üß† Simple Neural Network with NumPy

This project is a minimal implementation of a neural network using only **NumPy**. It demonstrates the basics of forward and backward propagation, activation functions (ReLU and Softmax), a loss function (categorical cross-entropy), and SGD optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine or a cloud environment like Google Colab.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-nn-numpy.git
cd simple-nn-numpy
```

### 2. Install dependencies

only Numpy is required

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 3. Run the main training script

```bash
python nn-main.py
```

### Example output

Every 100 epochs, you'll see updates like:

```yaml
Epoch 0, loss: 1.098, accuracy: 0.333
Epoch 100, loss: 0.953, accuracy: 0.667
...
Epoch 900, loss: 0.811, accuracy: 1.000
```
